### hi, i'm shin

fresh cs grad from SIT-UoG and this is where I may put up some posts on the side projects that I'm working on, but also ramble on about my hobbies.

### hobbies

I go around on chill rides around my neighbourhood on my fixed gear bike. I also hang out in FFXIV, and set aside some time each day to get better at solving leetcode problems.

I (used to) play some competitive rts quite a bit like starcraft 2, age of empires 4, dota.

### for employers

you can find a copy of my resume [here](https://github.com/twirle/Awesome-CV/blob/master/resume.pdf).
